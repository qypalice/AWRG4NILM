# AWRG4NILM
## Introduction
This is a replication of Adaptive Weighted Recurrence Graphs replication in NILM.The code is a reorganized and simplified version of the origin author, which has the basic functions. Due to time limit it is not perfect, but it is easy to read and use.

## Usage
Open "./noteboook/Repliation.ipynb", and then run the code.
If extra dataset needed, process it and put the dataset in "./data" in the same format.
The training process is recored in "./logs", including a txt file and csv file.
The weight file is recorded in "./weight" as a .pt file.
The result scores are recorded in "./results" as a .txt file.
